# Amplicon_analysis_with_QIIME2

QIIME 2â„¢ is a next-generation microbiome bioinformatics platform that is extensible, free, open-source, and community developed.

This pipeline was created based on the [QIIME2](https://qiime2.org) guide published in [Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0209-9)

For this specific project, data was obtained by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from environmental samples. The details can be found in the published manuscript [Prior exposure of microbial communities to seawater reduces resilience but increases compositional and functional resistance to flooding events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972303663X?casa_token=5tdKt6sHuGYAAAAA:cQ-jWRa4Ffc72-Y_xM6N7QS62lw55WUNzSCo5t1QUYd2pUvqdTMZeauk0miEDyZL2vfF6To)
